## <a id="hardware-design"></a>Hardware Architecture Design

### System Block Diagram

The system architecture is built around a central ESP32-S3 controller with multiple subsystems:

```
[ESP32-S3 Controller]
    ├── WiFi/BT Radio
    ├── I2C Bus
    │   ├── GPIO Expanders (MCP23017)
    │   ├── Temperature Sensors (DS18B20)
    │   ├── RTC Module (DS3231)
    │   └── OLED Display (SSD1306)
    ├── SPI Bus
    │   ├── SD Card Module
    │   └── Ethernet Module (W5500)
    ├── UART Interfaces
    │   ├── Zigbee Module (CC2530)
    │   └── Debug Console
    └── Analog Inputs
        ├── Current Sensors (ACS712)
        └── Light Level Sensors (LDR)
```

### Key Design Decisions

**Modular Architecture**: The system uses a modular approach with separate PCBs for different functions, connected via standardized connectors.

**Redundant Communication**: Both WiFi and Ethernet connectivity ensure reliable network access, with Zigbee for low-power sensor networks.

**Local Processing**: Critical functions operate locally to ensure reliability even without internet connectivity.

- **USB-C connector** for programming and power
- **Modular expansion slots** for daughter boards
- **ESD protection** on all external interfaces
- **Switching power supply** for efficiency

### Design Considerations

**EMI/EMC Compliance**:
- Proper ground plane design
- Ferrite beads on high-speed signals
- Shielded enclosure compatibility

**Thermal Management**:
- Thermal vias under power components
- Heat sink mounting provision
- Temperature monitoring points

**Manufacturing**:
- All components selected for automated assembly
- Test points for production testing
- JTAG interface for debugging

## <a id="firmware"></a>Firmware Development

### Software Architecture

The firmware is built using ESP-IDF with FreeRTOS, implementing a task-based architecture:

```cpp
// Main application tasks
class HomeAutomationController {
private:
    TaskHandle_t webServerTask;
    TaskHandle_t sensorTask;
    TaskHandle_t lightingTask;
    TaskHandle_t securityTask;
    
    WebServer webServer;
    SensorManager sensorManager;
    LightingController lightingController;
    SecuritySystem securitySystem;
    
public:
    void initialize();
    void startTasks();
    void processCommands();
};

// Example lighting control implementation
class LightingController {
private:
    struct LightZone {
        uint8_t pin;
        uint8_t brightness;
        bool isOn;
        LightType type;
    };
    
    std::array<LightZone, 16> zones;
    
public:
    void setZoneBrightness(uint8_t zone, uint8_t brightness);
    void toggleZone(uint8_t zone);
    void setSchedule(uint8_t zone, const Schedule& schedule);
};
```

### Key Features Implementation

- **Backend**: Node.js REST API
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets
- **Database**: SQLite for configuration, InfluxDB for time-series data

### Mobile Application

Cross-platform mobile app built with React Native:

```typescript
// Example React Native component for lighting control
const LightingControl: React.FC = () => {
  const [zones, setZones] = useState<LightZone[]>([]);
  
  const toggleZone = async (zoneId: number) => {
    try {
      await api.post(`/lighting/zones/${zoneId}/toggle`);
      updateZoneStatus(zoneId);
    } catch (error) {
      showError('Failed to toggle light zone');
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <ScrollView>
      {zones.map(zone => (
        <LightZoneCard 
          key={zone.id}
          zone={zone}
          onToggle={() => toggleZone(zone.id)}
          onBrightnessChange={(brightness) => 
            updateZoneBrightness(zone.id, brightness)
          }
        />
      ))}
    </ScrollView>
  );
};
```
