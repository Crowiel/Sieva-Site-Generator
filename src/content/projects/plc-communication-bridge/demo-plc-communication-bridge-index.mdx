# Industrial PLC Communication Bridge

This project involved developing a custom communication bridge to modernize legacy industrial automation systems by enabling connectivity between older PLCs and modern SCADA systems.

## <a id="analysis"></a>Project Background

Many industrial facilities operate with legacy PLCs that use proprietary or outdated communication protocols. This creates challenges when integrating with modern SCADA systems, IoT platforms, and cloud-based monitoring solutions.

### The Challenge

- **Legacy Systems**: 15-year-old PLCs with RS-485 and proprietary protocols
- **Modern Requirements**: Need for Ethernet connectivity and standard protocols
- **Minimal Downtime**: Industrial processes cannot be interrupted for upgrades
- **Cost Constraints**: Full PLC replacement would be extremely expensive

## <a id="protocols"></a>Protocol Implementation

### Supported Protocols

**Legacy Side**:
- Modbus RTU over RS-485
- Proprietary serial protocols (manufacturer-specific)
- ASCII-based command protocols

**Modern Side**:
- Modbus TCP/IP
- OPC-UA
- MQTT for IoT integration
- RESTful API for web-based access

### Communication Architecture

```cpp
class ProtocolBridge {
private:
    SerialInterface legacyPort;
    EthernetInterface modernPort;
    ProtocolTranslator translator;
    DataBuffer sharedMemory;
    
public:
    class ModbusRTUHandler {
        void readHoldingRegisters(uint16_t address, uint16_t count);
        void writeMultipleRegisters(uint16_t address, const uint16_t* data);
        void processResponse(const uint8_t* response);
    };
    
    class ModbusTCPServer {
        void handleClientConnection(TCPSocket& client);
        void processModbusTCPRequest(const uint8_t* request);
        void sendModbusTCPResponse(const uint8_t* response);
    };
    
    void startBridge();
    void processDataExchange();
};
```

## <a id="hardware"></a>Hardware Platform

### System Specifications

- **Processor**: ARM Cortex-M7 (STM32H743)
- **Memory**: 1MB Flash, 1MB RAM
- **Interfaces**: 
  - 2x RS-485 ports (galvanically isolated)
  - Ethernet 10/100 Mbps
  - USB for configuration
  - SD card for data logging

### Design Features

**Galvanic Isolation**: All interfaces are isolated to prevent ground loops and improve safety in industrial environments.

**Redundant Power Supply**: Supports both 24V DC industrial power and PoE (Power over Ethernet).

**Environmental Protection**: IP65 rated enclosure suitable for factory floor installation.

## <a id="testing"></a>Implementation Results

### Performance Metrics

- **Latency**: <10ms for standard Modbus transactions
- **Throughput**: 1000 transactions per second
- **Reliability**: 99.95% uptime in 6-month field testing
- **Concurrent Connections**: Up to 20 SCADA clients simultaneously

### Field Deployment

Successfully deployed in 3 manufacturing facilities:

1. **Automotive Parts Manufacturing**: 25 legacy PLCs connected to modern MES system
2. **Food Processing Plant**: Integration with new quality monitoring system
3. **Chemical Processing**: Connection to cloud-based predictive maintenance platform

## Technical Challenges Solved

### Real-time Performance
Implemented priority-based message queuing to ensure critical control commands are processed immediately while allowing bulk data transfers to proceed in background.

### Protocol Translation
Developed comprehensive mapping system to translate between different data representations and addressing schemes used by legacy and modern systems.

### Industrial Reliability
Implemented watchdog systems, automatic recovery mechanisms, and comprehensive error logging to ensure 24/7 operation in harsh industrial environments.
