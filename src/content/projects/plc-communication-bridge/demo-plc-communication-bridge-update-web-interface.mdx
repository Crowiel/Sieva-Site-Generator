# Web Interface Update - Real-time Dashboard

This update introduces a comprehensive real-time monitoring dashboard for the PLC Communication Bridge, providing operators with immediate visibility into system status and performance metrics.

## New Features

### Live Data Visualization
- **Real-time Charts**: Interactive charts showing data flow rates, response times, and error rates
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicators for each connected PLC and SCADA client
- **Historical Trends**: 24-hour trend analysis with configurable time ranges

### Enhanced Monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Live monitoring of CPU usage, memory consumption, and network throughput
- **Alert System**: Configurable alerts for connection failures, high latency, and error conditions
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Built-in network diagnostics and troubleshooting utilities

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates and D3.js for data visualization:

```typescript
interface DashboardMetrics {
  connectionCount: number;
  throughput: number;
  responseTime: number;
  errorRate: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

class RealtimeDashboard {
  private websocket: WebSocket;
  private metricsChart: D3Chart;
  
  constructor() {
    this.initializeWebSocket();
    this.setupCharts();
  }
  
  private updateMetrics(data: DashboardMetrics): void {
    this.metricsChart.addDataPoint(data);
    this.updateStatusIndicators(data);
  }
}
```

## Deployment Results

- **Response Time**: Dashboard updates in <50ms from device
- **Data Retention**: 30-day historical data storage
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design works on tablets and phones
- **User Adoption**: 95% of operators now use the dashboard daily

This update significantly improves system visibility and operational efficiency.
