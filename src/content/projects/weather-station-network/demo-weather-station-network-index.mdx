# Embedded Weather Station Network

Development of a network of autonomous weather monitoring stations for agricultural and environmental monitoring applications.

## <a id="sensors"></a>System Overview

The weather stations collect comprehensive environmental data including:

- Temperature and humidity (±0.1°C, ±2% RH accuracy)
- Atmospheric pressure (±0.1 hPa)
- Wind speed and direction
- Rainfall measurement
- Solar irradiance
- Soil temperature and moisture

## <a id="lorawan"></a>Communication Architecture

Each station transmits data via LoRaWAN to a central gateway, providing:

- **Range**: Up to 15km in rural environments
- **Battery Life**: >5 years with solar charging
- **Data Rate**: Hourly measurements with alert capability
- **Network Capacity**: 100+ stations per gateway

## <a id="power"></a>Power Management

Sophisticated power management system featuring:

- 10W solar panel with MPPT charging
- 18650 Li-ion battery pack (7.2V, 6600mAh)
- Ultra-low power sleep modes (<10µA)
- Dynamic duty cycling based on battery level

## <a id="deployment"></a>Results

Successfully deployed 25 stations across 500 hectares of agricultural land, providing farmers with real-time weather data for irrigation and crop management decisions.
